#Implementation of Simple Linear Regression
#Steps:
"""
1) Preprocess the data -> Can be done by reusing the functions in DPP.py
    1. Handle missing values
    2. Apply feature scaling if required **
    3. Split the data into training and test sets

2) Fit the linear regression model found in the sklearn package

** -> Some functions take have built-in feature scaling. Read the documentation once to be thorough
